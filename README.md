# WASM-lab
A simple lab to experiment with wasm

Please, when cloning, use ```git clone --recursive git@github.com:ExcelliumSA/WASM-lab.git``` so you have the wasm toolkit.

An easy way to have the lab running is to use ```python3 -m http.server 80```. Don't use the ```file://``` protocol in your browser, it won't load correctly.
