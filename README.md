# WASM-lab

A simple lab to experiment with [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

🌎 This lab is deployed using GitHub pages so you can access it [here](https://excelliumsa.github.io/WASM-lab/).


# Local hosting

💻 The **[WASM Toolkit](https://github.com/ExcelliumSA/WASMToolkit)** is already included so you can use it directly in your browser's console.

💡 An easy way to have the lab running is to use `python3 -m http.server 80`.

❌ Don't use the `file://` protocol in your browser, it won't load correctly.
